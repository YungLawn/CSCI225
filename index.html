        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p> My name is Chris Teelon and I'm a sophomore at USC Aiken. My Major is Applied Computer Science with a concentration in 
            cyber security. I enjoy playing video games, watching TV, playing with my dog, and sleeping. After college, I hope to get 
            a job in computer science because I really enjoy coding and learning about computers.</p>
